                    <p>Do you want to know how to design and program the computers powering some of today’s greatest
                        innovations? <br>
                        Ever wondered how your phone knows where the nearest Starbucks is, how Google’s self-driving car
                        is even possible, or how your music and photos live in the cloud? <br>
                        <br>
                        Maybe you want to know how computers protect businesses — and people — and other cybersecurity
                        issues. <br>
                        AUM’s Computer Science Program, with a curriculum based on the latest ACM/IEEE recommendations
                        and an emphasis on high-performance computing, will prepare you for a career in computer
                        programming, networking, database management, multimedia design or technology architecture.
